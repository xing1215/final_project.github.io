## Fig 1: Destroy Towers

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
merge_file = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/merge.csv")

merge_file %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = b_result, y = outer_mean_diff)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Fig1: Time Length of Destroying Enemy's Towers vs. Battle Reuslts", 
    x = "Results of Blue Team",
    y = "Mean Time Difference of Destroying Towers"
  )
```


Variable outer_mean_diff represents the difference of average time destroying the enemy's three outer towers between blue and red team (i.e. outer_mean_diff = average time blue team used - average time red team used). And vairable b_result, encoded as win versus lose, represents the battle results of the blue team. From the boxplot above, we expect that the blue team has a greater chance to win the game when the difference is negative, meaning the blue team takes less average time to destory the red team's outer towers.

## Fig 2 Team Economic Differences

![](gold_diff.png)

Variable golddiff_mean represents the average monetary difference in every minute during the game between blue and red team (blue-red). From the boxplot, we expect that the blue team has a greater chance to win when the team has more golds in average.

## Fig 3 Neutrals Eliminated

In this figure, we try to explore which neutral monsters have a higher effects in contributing to the battle results. The largest difference exists in the kills of baron_nashor.
