# data cleaning


## read and clean the tower data

```{r}
tower = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/structures.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(team == "bTowers", type == "OUTER_TURRET") %>% 
  mutate(
    address = str_remove(address, "http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/")
  )
```

calculate the mean time, group by match id

```{r}
tower = 
  tower %>% 
  group_by(address) %>% 
  mutate(
    outer_tower = mean(time, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

join with the overall dataset

```{r}
overall = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/LeagueofLegends.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(address = str_remove(address, "http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/TRLH1/")) %>% 
  select(address, b_result)

merge_file = 
  left_join(overall, tower, by = "address") %>% 
  mutate(b_result = recode_factor(b_result, "1" = "win", "0" = "lose"))
```

some visualizations

```{r}
merge_file %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = b_result, y = outer_tower)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
